    This repository is to track and backup my progress while
working through the book The Way To Go. Each chapter starting with number
four will have its own folder. Each exercise will have its own folder in
the appropriate folder for its chapter. Each chapter will have a main.go
file for notes. The master has a paste.go for utilizing code highlighting
features for better code extrapolation.
